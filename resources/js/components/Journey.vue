            As long as I can remember, I have been deeply fascinated with technology and the potential it
            holds. I was one of those kids that was constantly tinkering.
            It may have been a simple toy with some spin-able wheels, a complicated lego set, or even
            something as simple as a remote control - I would dissemble whatever it was piece by piece and
            then try to reassemble the parts into a singular whole again. I wanted to know how everything
            worked and if I could rebuild it.
            That intuitive aspiration to discover why things worked and how things worked is ultimately what
            lead me down the path towards software development. I wanted to create, build, and develop - and
            software engineering was the quickest way for me to be able to do that.
            After graduating high school, I enrolled at UMKC as a computer science major. UMKC was an
            amazing experience where I encountered a multitude of interesting people who were extremely
            intelligent in several varying facets of life. I loved it. I wanted to put my self in the best position
            possible to learn as much as I could from as many people as I could. I joined several teams, clubs,
            and events.
            Although I enjoyed most of the activities I joined, I felt most productive and creative when working
            with the robotics team. We were able to take what I was learning in the class room and translate that
            to a real world physical behavior through our robots. My junior year of college I was invited to
            become the Presidents of the robotics club, ultimately placing the responsibility of reviewing our
            current project management processes and improving them.
            This drove me to learn everything I could about Scrum and Agile practices. As president of the
            robotics club, I introduced the rest of our team members to version control through git, scrum
            sprints and daily stand ups, and several architecture patterns such as MVC. At this point I had
            worked a lot with Laravel on free lance and personal side projects - so my goal was to take all of the
            design principles I had learned in real world software development scenarios and to use them on our
            Robotics team. We were extremely successful, winning multiple competitions.
            Outside of having experience managing a team and implementing scrum practices, I also have a lot
            of real world experience when it comes to developing software. I&#39;ve created several Laravel
            applications, created a multitude of custom scripts to hook into several APIs - especially cloud
            APIs, and have managed and maintained several servers for both displaying my personal projects
            and creating staging sites for clients.
            My favorite tool set to work with is the powerful combination of Laravel as the back-end, Vue as
            the front-end, Vagrant, Homestead, Git Lab, Slack, NPM for JavaScript package management,
            Composer for PHP package management, and Nginx for working with my servers. I have found that
            this tool set allows for very maintainable, expandable, and efficient code bases - ultimately allow
            the delivery of a project in a high-quality and time efficient manner.
            I have worked on several large scale applications, including a customized scrum board and a crypto
            currency application responsible for notifying users of crypto-currencies that have recently gone
            public via SMS and email. 
            On top of having an immense amount of experience working with large scale projects and the tools
            that they require, I have also worked with WordPress frequently. I have created custom Wordpress
            plug-ins, custom Wordpress themes, and unique multi-site installations that allow for targeting
            niche locations. 
            After managing the university Robotics team and implementing scrum and agile principles,
            developing full-scale applications using frameworks such as Laravel and Vue, implementing the
            power of version control, and creating customized themes and plug-ins with WordPress - I can

            confidently say that going into software development was a great decision that has paid off in
            Spades.
            My technical skill set, experience of leading a team via Scrum principles, and my desire to learn
            would be a valuable asset to any project or application. I would love the chance to learn more about
            your opportunity and to offer up my experiences towards the betterment of your project.
            Thank you for the opportunity, and I look forward to hearing back from you soon.
